# SubstitutionCipher

this is the basic form of the subsitution cipher 
substitution cipher

Steps for the algorithm :

1. Declare two strings a and b;
2. the two strings are 
a ="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
b = "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"

3. Read the user string to decrypt
4.Declare one string variable of string type as decrypt
5. Create a looop to iterate on the string of the 
user input
6.read each charater and substitute the character by character to the b string
7. print all the string 
8. Here we get the output as the decrpyted string
